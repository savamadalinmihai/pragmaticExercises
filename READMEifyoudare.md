# pragmaticExercises

This is a repo for many exercises that I completed from the Pragmatic Exercises challenges book, in order to improve my skills with Java.

In here, I finished exercises that focus on calculations, making decisions, functions, repetitions, data structures and so on. 

I tried to make everything as organised as possible and easy to run so that's why every class has its own main method, to be able to run independently of all other classes.
